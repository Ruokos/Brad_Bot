My boyfriend (29m) and I (27f) have been together for 3 years and recently moved in together.

We've always had a really great relationship, but since moving in together we've had a couple of small arguments, which I think is mostly normal as we acclimate to sharing a living space. 

I realize I could have some form of OCD, but I cannot stand the thought of outside clothes touching my bed. Immediately after moving in together, I noticed that my boyfriend has a habit of sitting/laying on our bed after he gets home from work, and before he changes clothes or showers. This seriously repulses me. We both take public transport everywhere and I can't stand the thought of him sitting on a dirty, germ infested train, and then coming home and laying in our bed with those same clothes on.

I pointed this out to him the first time I saw him do it, and he didn't really see what the big deal was but he said he'd try to be mindful of it. 

Last night he came home from work, and what do you know, decides to lay down in our bed with his filthy outside clothes on. I had literally JUST washed all of our bedding, and was extremely upset that now I'd have to do it all over again. I confronted him about it, and he told me that he had a long and hard day at work and just felt like he needed to decompress for a bit. I asked him why he couldn't do that on the couch then, or even just shower and change his clothes first. 

He told me I was being an asshole and that I didn't seem to care about how he was feeling. I reminded him that we'd already talked about this, and that he *knows* I don't like it. I understand that outside clothes on the bed don't bother him in the same way it does me...but this is seriously one small ask and I feel like he should be willing to compromise, especially because he knows it drives me insane. And frankly, it's just gross. 

AITA?
